  ### Applications of binary trees
   * Binary Search Tree - Used in many search applications where data is constantly entering/leaving, such as the map and set objects in many languages' libraries.
  * Binary Space Partition - Used in almost every 3D video game to determine what objects need to be rendered.
  * Binary Tries - Used in almost every high-bandwidth router for storing router-tables.
  * Hash Trees - used in p2p programs and specialized image-signatures in which a hash needs to be verified, but the whole file is not available.
  * Heaps - Used in implementing efficient priority-queues, which in turn are used for scheduling processes in many operating systems, Quality-of-Service in routers, and A* (path-finding algorithm used in AI applications, including robotics and video games). Also used in heap-sort.
  * Huffman Coding Tree (Chip Uni) - used in compression algorithms, such as those used by the .jpeg and .mp3 file-formats.
  * GGM Trees - Used in cryptographic applications to generate a tree of pseudo-random numbers.
  * Syntax Tree - Constructed by compilers and (implicitly) calculators to parse expressions.
  * Treap - Randomized data structure used in wireless networking and memory allocation.
  * T-tree - Though most databases use some form of B-tree to store data on the drive, databases which keep all (most) their data in memory often use T-trees to do so.
  * Advantages of BSTs over Hashmaps
    * BSTs seem to be very effective when you need relative ordering.
    * Frequent additions or removals lend themselves to BSTs IF the collection must be resized.
    * BSTs are also better for very small datasets (< 20 items).

# Heaps
* Special type of Tree - all items are in specific order 
* Think of a sorted tree.
* The are also called priority queues
# Tries
* https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/data-structures/advanced-data-structures/trie-keyword-tree/tutorial/
  * You need to understand Tree Traversal to work well with tries
